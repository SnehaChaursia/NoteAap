## 🚀 How It Works

1. A splash screen with a coffee animation appears when the app loads.  
2. After a short delay, the main note-taking interface becomes visible.  
3. You can:
   - ✍️ Add notes using the input field
   - 📝 Edit existing notes
   - ❌ Delete notes
4. Notes are saved locally using the **`localStorage`** API – no login needed!
